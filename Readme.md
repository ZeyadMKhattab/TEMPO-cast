**Global TEMPO** is a public health application that makes life-saving air quality data accessible to everyone. It integrates real-time satellite data from **NASA's TEMPO mission** with global ground sensors and weather forecasts to provide a complete, localized picture of the air we breathe.

The platform not only visualizes complex pollution data on an interactive map but also sends **personalized health alerts** to vulnerable users based on their specific health profiles. By combining satellite technology, a custom-built local sensor network, and a user-centric design, Global TEMPO empowers communities to understand their environment and take action to protect their health.

## ✨ Features

### Core Application

- **📊 Real-Time AQI & Weather**: Get up-to-the-minute Air Quality Index (AQI) based on US EPA standards, integrated with current weather context.
- **🗺️ Interactive Global Map**: A Leaflet-based map to visualize air quality for any location worldwide.
- **📈 Forecasts & Historical Trends**: View hourly air quality forecasts and analyze historical data trends to understand pollution patterns.
- **🌐 Multi-Language Support**: Fully internationalized interface supporting both English and Arabic (RTL).
- **🔍 Advanced Search**: Find locations by city name, coordinates, or by using your device's current location.

### 🛰️ Satellite Data Integration

- **NASA TEMPO Viewer**: A dedicated map interface to visualize near real-time NO₂, O₃, and Formaldehyde data layers directly from the NASA TEMPO satellite over North America.
- **GEMS Satellite Data**: Integrates data from South Korea's GEMS satellite, providing similar air quality insights over Asia.
- **On-Demand Loading**: GEMS satellite imagery is fetched and cached on-demand by the server to ensure performance and data freshness.

### 🔔 Personalized Notification System

- **Health-Profile Based Alerts**: Users can subscribe to notifications and create a detailed health profile (age, respiratory conditions like asthma, pregnancy, etc.).
- **Customizable Triggers**: Set personal AQI thresholds and notification frequency (real-time, daily, etc.) to receive alerts that matter to you.
- **Intelligent Backend**: A cron job runs hourly, checking air quality for each subscriber's location and sending beautifully formatted HTML email alerts with personalized health advice when thresholds are met.
- **Full Subscription Management**: Users can subscribe, manage preferences, and unsubscribe through secure, unique links.

### 🔬 Community Science & Hardware

- **Arduino Prototype**: A custom-built, Arduino-based hardware sensor for hyper-local environmental monitoring (Temperature, Humidity, Light, Rain, Water Temperature).
- **Open Hardware**: A dedicated page showcases the hardware design and data transmission workflow, encouraging community participation and data contribution.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeyad-khattab/Global-TEMPO.git
cd Global-TEMPO
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys and database connection string:

```ini
# API Keys
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
OPENAQ_API_KEY=your_openaq_api_key
OPEN_API_GEMS=your_gems_api_key

# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# Optional: only if Node cannot resolve MongoDB Atlas through your local DNS
MONGODB_DNS_SERVERS=8.8.8.8

# Email Service (for notifications)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
CONTACT_EMAIL=your_contact_form_recipient@example.com
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
node server.js
```

### 5️⃣ Access the App

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploying to Netlify

In the Netlify site settings, add `MONGODB_URI` and the API/email variables used by the app as environment variables, then redeploy. `MONGODB_URI` must be a MongoDB Atlas connection string; the local MongoDB fallback is intentionally not used by Netlify Functions. Make sure the Atlas cluster's network access rules allow connections from your Netlify deployment.

Netlify Functions use Netlify's DNS resolver; `MONGODB_DNS_SERVERS` is only applied during local server runs. Subscriber notifications run through the hourly `notifications-schedule` function on Netlify.
